Fig. S1. Climate characterization of the study area based on synthetic data (historical series) and temperature and relative humidity sensors in greenhouses. 

Fig. S2. Evaluation of the effect of the height and trap color on capturing adults of Prodiplosis longifila. A. Traps installed in the first trial. B. Yellow and white traps for all trials. C. Satellite view of the field, map and location of the traps for spatial dynamics analysis.

Fig. S3. Evaluation of the effect of the date, height and trap color on capturing adults of Prodiplosis longifila for trial 3.

Fig. S4.  Population dynamics of Prodiplosis longifilia in foliage. A. Population fluctuation based on trap color; B. Population fluctuation based on date of assessment; C. Population fluctuation based on infestation level; C. Population fluctuation based on plot. In each figure, the evaluated variables that captured a total number of adults with significant differences are indicated with black asterisks depending on the p-value: * = 0.01 < p ≤ 0.05; ** = 0.001 < p ≤ 0.01; *** = 0.0001 < p ≤ 0.001; **** = p ≤ 0.0001.
